### Challenge 16: Graph
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:
1. AddNode()
    * Adds a new node to the graph
    * Takes in the value of that node
    * Returns the added node
2. AddEdge()
    * Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
    * Include the ability to have a “weight”
    * Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
    * Both nodes should already be in the Graph
3. GetNodes()
    * Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
4. GetNeighbors()
    * Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
    * Takes in a given node
    * Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
5. Size()
    * Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

### Challenge 17: Breadth First Graph
Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection.
